1. KClosestPoints.cpp : Find the k closest points which are closer to vertex.

## General:
1. MaxAreaHistogram.cpp : Maximum rectangle area of the given histogram. 
2. ZeroSumSubArray.cpp : Find the zero sum contiguous sub-array.
3. FindTwoMissing.java : Find the two missing elements from 1 to n in the given array.
4. FindDuplicates.java : Find the duplicate elements in the given array containing 1 to n.
5. KthMostFrequent.java : Find the kth most frequent string in a given list of strings.
6. IsBinaryTreeBalanced : Check if the given binary tree is balanced in O(N) time and O(1) space.
7. MakeChange : Make change for the given input using minimum number of coins. O(N*N) space and time.
